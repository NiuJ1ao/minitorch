# Minitorch
This is a simple PyTorch-like library for personal use, generated from [MiniTorch](https://minitorch.github.io/). 

The project is implemented for the following purposes:

1. Familiar with the design and optimizations of machine learning libraries.
2. Practice C++ skills.
3. Learn parallelism and CUDA.

## TODO
- [ ] Replace numpy NDArray with my own implementation.
- [ ] Replace numba CPU parallelism with my OpenMP implementation (also considering other approaches).
- [ ] Replace numba GPU parallelism with my CUDA implementation.
